  # There are two different types of recipes:
  # "shaped":
  #   They have a certain pattern defining where you have
  #   to place your items/blocks on the workbench.

  #   They don't have a specific pattern and you can
  #   place the ingredients on your workbench wherever you want.

  # At first you define your items/blocks you want to use in
  # your recipe and give them a letter as a variable name.
  # E.g. S: 'OAK_SIGN'
  # Hint: Use 'ANY_SIGN' for to make it work for any kind of sign.
  # You can use data values as well.

  # you want. A whitespace represents air.
  # Remember that it is not possible to have more
  # than three characters (whitespaces included) in one line!

  # If "crafting.recipeType" is set to "shapeless", the order
  # and assigned variable names don't matter!
