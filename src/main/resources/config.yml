# English (EN) and German (DE) are implemented by default.
# You can add your own language by adding a
# lang-YOUR_LANG_CODE.yml file to the plugin's folder.
# If you want your language file to be included in the plugin
# natively, open a pull request at the plugin's GitHub repository.

# Recipe settings section.
# You'll have to restart the server, if you make changes here!
recipes:
  # There are two different types of recipes:
  # "shaped":
  #   They have a certain pattern defining where you have
  #   to place your items/blocks on the workbench.
  #
  # "shapeless":
  #   They don't have a specific pattern and you can
  #   place the ingredients on your workbench wherever you want.
  type: 'shaped'
  # ONLY enabled if "recipes.type" is set to "shaped"!
  # At first you define your items/blocks you want to use in
  # your recipe and give them a letter as a variable name.
  # E.g. S: 'SIGN'
  # You can use data values as well.
  # E.g. T: 'WOOL:9'
  # This would represent cyan wool.
  # Generally the ingredients pattern is:
  # VARIABLE_LETTER: "MATERIAL_NAME:DATA_VALUE"
  # The "crafting_shape" represents the workbench. Each line
  # in the list equals a line at the workbench. Here you
  # can use your defined variables and place them where
  # you want. A whitespace represents air.
  # Remember that it is not possible to have more
  # than three characters (whitespaces included) in one line!
