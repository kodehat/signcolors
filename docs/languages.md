# Languages

The plugins comes with built-in *English* and *German* translations. More can be added manually.

## Adding a custom language

1. Copy the `en_US.properties` in the `translations` folder
and name it after your language (e.g. `fr.properties`).
2. Adjust the translation values within the file.
3. Set the `language` key in the `config.yml` to your language file code
(e.g. `fr` from the example above).
4. Reload the plugin or restart the server to make use of the new translations.
